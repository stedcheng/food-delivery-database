<h1>How was Your Order? Querying Transaction Data from a Generated Database based on a Food Delivery App Use Case</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
This project (with its corresponding <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LLoYcAkwMC-jsNS5xYUIUehkXF68Cyhq&usp=drive_copy">video</a>) shows how MongoDB can be used to query transaction data in the context of a food delivery app. The development environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS) was set up, and the process in the use case was explained through an entity relationship diagram (ERD), containing customer, rider, restaurant, and transaction entities. Data was generated based on the ERD and appropriately converted into JSON format for proper inputting in MongoDB. Nine sample queries to demonstrate how the database can be used to streamline the operations of the food delivery app.
